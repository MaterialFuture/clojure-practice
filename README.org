#+TITLE: Learning Clojure

This is a project to show my work alongside reading ~Clojure for the Brave and True~ as well as other programming challenges.

* Structure
- First Steps
  - core + practice = Clojure book stuff
  - recursion is testing recursion
- Challenges
  - For online programming challenges
* Resources
- https://clojuredocs.org
- https://clojure-toolbox.com/
- https://projecteuler.net/
- https://clojuredocs.org/

* Run
Load the files you want to test in the repl by loading them.
Items in challenges will have tests, except cw things to ensure people on there don't try to copy work.
